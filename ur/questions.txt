## Should beam have a top-level "path" for every message?

Cons:
	* One more special case
	* Shouldn't navigation be call-to-call?
	* Doesn't it conflict with capital-N Names, enforced by crypto etc?

Pros:
	* With discreet logging, we get a firehose of mixed logging events. We need an
	identifier to distinguish the sources.

Solution: perhaps every program has a name. Every runtime starts at the special root "/local"
which is a special case.

Names by definition are federated. The framework can dictate rules for who is allowed to
use which name... but the rules are enforced by each runtime. A rogue runtime can choose
to ignore the rules for itself. Or a legitimate runtime can follow the rules, but be
out of sync with the hub because it only updates once a day. Thus the technical reality is that:

```
<engine_id_foo>:/ubuntu/cloudimage:14.04
<engine_id_bar>:/ubuntu/cloudimage:14.04
```

Might not be the same.



## Can tags be mutated?


## Rename "beam" to "libus" or "libservice"?

	* libservice is a lightweight library for exposing and consuming lightweight network services in a distributed environment
