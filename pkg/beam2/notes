* Use ojf for sending KEY=VALUE messages

* To send collections: extend ojf with empty key (similar to kafka key-less messages)

* Use ojf for on-disk database?

* http api supports JSON. Is that a legacy format, or does ojf support multi-format?

* if ojf supports multi-format, how does format negotiation work?

* How to nest a job into a stream? Is there a "control stream"?





Beam seeks to supersede the following:

1) docker remote api (communicating with a remote docker daemon)
2) docker service discovery (a container connecting to other containers)
3) docker introspection (a container interacting with its docker engine)
4) application logging (print to stdout / stderr as a special case)
5) systemd journal logging
6) systemd socket activation
